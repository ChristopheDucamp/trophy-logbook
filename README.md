# Trophy Logbook â€“ A Jekyll Journal

This is a variant of the [Trophy](https://github.com/thomasvaeth/trophy-jekyll) Jekyll theme designed to be used as a personal logbook or diary. Since it is based on a traditional blog platform, it uses some of Jekyll's built-in functionality in *very* nonstandard ways. Obviously, these are personal, editorial decisions that made sense for my logging needs and interests. Your mileage will certainly vary.

## "Features"
- Post "tags" and "categories" have been hijacked to serve as person and location records, respectively. With help from [Jekyll Archives](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-archives), this allows for the automatic creation of records that answer such probing questions such as "How many times I have I really gone to Chipotle this year?" or "When was the last time I hung out with Jane?"
    + Additionally, by using Trophy's "_categories" folder, you can create a description and a picture to supplement these entries. Here's an example, noting that the "Enounters" are automatically generated.
- Automatically generated maps using the Google Static Maps API.
